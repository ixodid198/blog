      <description>My earlier experience with Wordpress made me think there had to be a better way to do simple, reliable sites online. A blog is static, meaning everyone sees the same content. Yihui Xie from RStudio created what for my needs is a better way to host content.
The web is built with HTML, Javascript and css. Everything boils down to these eventually. But that doesnâ€™t mean you have to use these languages directly to make sites for the web.</description>
