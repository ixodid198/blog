      <description>What if we added the median home price of just detached homes in Toronto? This was tough data to get so I only have data for the start and end dates. Since detached homes, as a group, are generally more expensive than other types of homes I wondered whether the rate of appreciation of a home had to do with its cost. Do more expensive homes appreciate faster?
This plot looks at median, detached home prices in different areas of central Toronto.</description>
