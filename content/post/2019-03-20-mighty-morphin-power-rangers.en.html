<p>Apropos of nothing I was thinking about how impressed I was when I first saw the morphing faces in Michael Jackson’s <em>Black or White</em> 1991 short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTFE8cirkdQ">film</a> (face morph begins at 5:27) directed by John Landis. Then I saw Thomas Lin Pedersen’s <a href="https://github.com/thomasp85/transformr">transformr</a> package and thought I’d play around a little. The result is <a href="https://www.lawrencepilch.com/morph">here</a>. The slower the cooler it looks, but the longer the wait to generate the animation. Enjoy.</p>
<p>Note: Here’s an oral <a href="https://www.cartoonbrew.com/vfx/oral-history-morphing-michael-jacksons-black-white-144015.html">history</a> of the work that went into the morphing faces.</p>
